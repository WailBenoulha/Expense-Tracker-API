# Expense-Tracker-API
An Expenses Tracker API built with Django Rest Framework (DRF) for tracking expenses, incomes, and generating financial reports. The API allows users to manage their financial data effectively, with features like calculating total expenses and income over specified periods. The project uses PostgreSQL as the database, includes Docker for containerization, and is fully documented using Swagger. Secure authentication is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
